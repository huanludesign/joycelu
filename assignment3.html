            <p>
            I ideated several ideas on the whiteboard, and iterated based on feasiblity and desirability.

            <p>
              Then I started to use Rhino to create the shapes. It is a fun learning process, following Nadya's wonderful tutorial. Some mistakes I made during the process include forgetting to draw a hole in the middle to let the lamp socket get through. Building 3D models on Rhino for the first time was also challenging for me. So I went back and forth and finally build the one that I liked.

            <p>
             Finally, based on the different thickness of my files, I set the gaps of my vector shapes to 0.153 and 0.037 respectively.

                <b>Execution</b>
            </p>
            <p>
            I was more proficient in using the laser cutting machine this time :). Since the thickness of the two cardboards are different, I set the laser cutter different. For the thinner cardboard, my settings are:
            Speed-17;
            Power-51;
            Frequency-50.
            <p>
            <img src="settings.JPG" height=400></a>
            </p>

            <p>
            For the thicker cardboard, my settings are:
            Speed-25;
            Power-100;
            Frequency-50.
            </p>
            <p>
            Then the laser cutter did its job!

            My husband and I played around with the shapes I cut. Indeed, the combination of hexagons and decagons work very well and they created elegant shapes. My husband made a drone, and I made models of the Bird Nest (the Beijing Olympics Stadium).
