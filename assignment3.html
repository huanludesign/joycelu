            <b>Ideation</b>
            </p>
            <p>
            I ideated several ideas on the whiteboard, and iterated based on feasiblity and desirability.

            <p>
              Then I started to use Rhino to create the shapes. It is a fun learning process, following Nadya's wonderful tutorial. Some mistakes I made during the process include forgetting to draw a hole in the middle to let the lamp socket get through. Building 3D models on Rhino for the first time was also challenging for me. So I went back and forth and finally build the one that I liked.

             Based on my ideation, the thickness of my socket is 52 mm, which could fit my bulb in. Also, according to Joshua's suggetion, I set the thickness of the 3D model to be 0.3mm. Accordingly, the depth of the fit-in of the lamp pieces are also 0.3mm.

                <b>Execution</b>
            </p>
            <p>
            Then, learning that 3D printing take a much longer time, I printed my 3D model first. The first mistake I made was forgetting to try the fillament before printing, so for my first tiral, the fillament did not come out. The printer just made empty shapes on the glue lol.

            </p>

            <p>
            For a second trial, I followed the procedures correctly. However, I did not put enough glue, so that my first prototype failed in the middle of printing.

            </p>
            <p>
            Finally, for the last trial, my 3D model got printed (very slowly!). I used the setting recommended by the Mill staff and it worked well. Here is what it looked like with the lamp cord!

            </p>
            <p>
              Then I laser cut my lamp pieces. Laser cutting was so much easier and familiar for me now! Based on the thickness of my cardboard, my setting are: speed-25; power-100; frequency-70.

              Thanks Dawn for answering my questions at the Mill! Thanks Nadya for providing the tutorial.
