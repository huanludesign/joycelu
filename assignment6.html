            May 20th is one of the Chinese valentine's days because "520" pronounces as "I love you" in Chinese. For this year's 520, I decided to show some loves to my husband. I first went to Thingaverse and found this heart shape file. I then created a container in Rhino and imported the heart shape file. I made a mold and 3D printed it. The settings for the 3D printers were: nozzle temp-280; platform temp-100; print speed-100%; fan speed-100%.

              <b>Trials and Errors</b>
            </p>
            <p>
            For the first trial, my the gap between the container and the heart shape was too closed. I worried that there would be limited space for the silicone to fill, so I redid my  by enlarging the gaps between the container and the heart shape.

            <b>Execution</b>
            </p>
            <p>
            After the mold was 3D-printed, it was time to pour the silicone! I mixed the two types of oomoo by 1:1, and waited overnight for it to cure. The other day, I got a lovely rubber mold!

            Finally, I cast four love ice cubes for my husband. Sorry honey, not edible!
