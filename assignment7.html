            </p>
            <p>
            For the final project, I wanted to build something that I could use in the future. I have been thinking getting a new night stand lamp for a long time, as my current one is too bright and hurt my eyes (see image 1). I wanted to create a lamp with more coverage and bring more diffuse lighting. I have been seeking inspiration from online communities.

            I broke down the different parts of the lamp in this graphic.

            <b>Breakdown of Tasks</b>
            </p>
            <p>
            2D design: design patterns on the sides
            CAD: Design the top, bottom, and side pieces of the lamp and the joints in Onshape or Rhino
            Laser cut: side pieces -- Delrin (backup plan: woodboards); top and bottom piece -- muptiple layers of plywood, glue and paint them after cutting (backup: Delrin)
            3D print: 3D print the joints
            Assemble
            </p>

            <b>Timeline</b>
            <p>
            May 29: get feedback in class, adjust plan
            May 30: Finish 2D pattern design and CAD
            May 31: 3D print and laser-cut the materials
            June 1-2: paint; assemble
            </p>

            <b>Material and Estimated Costs</b>
            <p>
            Delrin: plan to purchase from Josh, estimated cost: $10-15
            Plywood: plan to purchase at the Mill, estimated cost:$7-14
            Paint: left-over paint at home
            3D printing filament: Source at the Mill (thanks Josh!)
