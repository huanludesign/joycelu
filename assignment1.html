            I was inspired by <a href="https://themakerbean.com/product/laser-cut-vase-with-test-tube/"> this</a > online vase design. I redesigned it based on my needs and created a vector file on illustrator. My cardboard is about 0.1112 inch, so I designed the vector shapes to have a 0.1 inch gap. Then I went to Mill and ran a test drive, observing the movement of the red dot of the laser. At first, I set the size of my artboard randomly, but I realized that it was best to set the artboard's size as the size of my cardboard so that the laser cutter wouldn't go out of boundary. I measured the size of my cardboard: 28*19 inch, so I set my illustrator artboard and the laser cutter printing setting accordingly. After aligning the printing setting to the size of my cardboard, I set the speed to 25 and power to 100. The second time it worked well! I was a little worried about the small flame around the laser when it was cutting but the staff there said it was normal.
